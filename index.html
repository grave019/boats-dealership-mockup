        <h1>F.A.S.T. Tab Hull</h1>
        <p>Patended and proven, Crownline's F.A.S.T. TAB Hull Design is one of the most efficient and attractive hull designs on the market today, improving slow-speed stability, time to plane acceleration and fuel economy.</p>
        <p>The acronym stands for fin-assisted safe turn. In practice, F.A.S.T. Tab Hull's vented chines aerate the running surface to reduce drag, and the fin like tabs deep those vents from producing handling quirks.the hull sticks in turns, is responsive to trim, and really airs out at speed. Chop back the throttle and your can feel the vents working as the boat glides along the quite some distance before settling off plane.</p>
        <p>There's always positive control with the most unique sport boat hull system running today.</p>
