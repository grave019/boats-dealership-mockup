  ## Goals

  * To increase the functionality of the mockup by researching the existing Crownline website. I was able to see what the client liked that already exist on their current website and expand the mockup pages for better user interface. 
  
  * I challenged myself to increase the functionality of the mockup while staying true to the excellent design of the mockup that was given to me. This included have all anchor elements that linked to the existing company site be opened in a new tab.

  * Research Bootstrap documentation along with W3 Schools to better understand coding and styling challenges that were faced in the development process.

  * Gather startup images and material Crownlines website or design materials needed to build the most accurate representation of the Mockup.
  
  * Create some degree of mobile responsiveness. Typically, best practices say to build a website mobile first then grow the page as it expands.

  ## Motivation

  Design a facsimile for a proposed update to an existing company's website for the purpose of demonstrating my current level of knowledge and capabilities.

  ## Problems

  * The film strip style carousel on the homepage was initially challenging. I had initally used a variation of a bootstrap carousel but was unhappy with the way it looked.  Overall, It was a wonderful experience to build a sample web page from a designed mockup.
  
  * Some design elements were difficult to replicate and I tried produce them to the best of my ability. I welcome any feedback you could give on the site.
  
  * Some degree of mobile responsiveness was achieved via the incorporation of bootstrap. It still is not where it should be for deployment.  

  ## Acknowledgements

  * The design team at Red Rocket Studios for designing a mockup that was easy to follow and wonderfully designed.
  
  * Ross Bernstein and Arianna Soto at Blue Wave for relaying communication about the project along with desired expectations.
